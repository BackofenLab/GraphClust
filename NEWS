	major refactoring in stage 7 (alignCenter.pl)
	CMfinder for center refinement can be used with 'center_model_type = 5'
	omit RNAsoup and use own tree align function
	parameter name changes, default parameter changes


September 24, 2012
	Master can be used with threads now! Perl needs to support it
	Job submission refactored, interruption is more clean now
	Results refactored again
	Multiple signals per input seq possible in evaluation mode
	Signal classes can have names
	Master output more pipe-friendly in non-verbose mode. It now prints
	information only for changes jobs.
	bugfix: configured ocatve pathis now really used, column did not work
	for large files

August 23, 2012
	GraphClust-0.6-rc3 release
	MASTER manpage via POD, see MASTER_GraphClust.pl --help and --man

August 21, 2012
	new procedure for input splitting/ fragmentation, we have more equal
	length frags now
	add some new config options for used partitition file
	locarna matrix overlap check bugfix
	merged partition: bugfix for overlapping fragments
	bugfix: bug in consMFE script if we have parallel instances,
	bugfix in simplealign selection

August 17, 2012
	Input preprocessing a bit changed, split and shift results in more equal length
	fragments, because we allow overlap for last fragment by default, min-len
	paramter is now only used to define the minimal length for input sequences
	new NSPDK version
	evaluation: class 0 signals can be ignored for fp-rates

August 13, 2012
	force cmsearch to always scan reverse strand if we added revcompl seqs by
	option 'input_add_revcompl=1'
	make sub fragment_overlap strand aware, ignore strand only for blacklist of
	data.svector (idea is that on revcompl of final hit is no other signal)

August 10, 2012
	bugfix RNAsoup: wrong aln file in xml tree
	Readme updates
	bugfix in config.default_global
	in greylist mode: add revcompl only for non-greylist sequences
	in greylist mode: filter final results to keep only clusters which are
	contain both greylist members and non-greylist members
	add support for enconding of fixed structures provided in input
	via #FS meta tag at end of line

August 2, 2012
	Initial public release, 0.6-rc2
